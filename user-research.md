# User Research Summary

## Overview

The Common Components teams’ research hypothesis is that we can reduce the time and cost of delivering digital products and services by making it easy to find, onboard to and use components like code and microservices that solve common problems across government. We know that there have been previous attempts at this work in B.C. and elsewhere in the world, and that not all have been successful. We think that by taking a user-centered approach and understanding our users’ needs and journeys, we can design Common Components so good that technologists in BC prefer to use them.

## Who are our users?

We started our user research by identifying and interviewing users of Common Components. We confirmed that our users are:
- *Technologists* like developers and architects who help select technology and build digital products services for government.
- *Service/Program Owners* who need to deliver part of their program or service digitally.
- *Designers* who design and prototype new government services and applications;
- *Procurement/Contract Managers* who shape procurement processes;
- *British Columbians* - the people and businesses that use online government services.

## Discovery Research

In January 2020, the Common Components Team began a Discovery Phase to understand our users and the problems we’re trying to solve with Common Components. 

To that end, we conducted extensive user research with technologists, designers, service/program owners and others in the BC Public Service. We’ve also reviewed previous research, analysis and service design work to avoid duplicative work. We also used prototyping to learn about users’ needs and test for [desirability, feasibility and viability](https://medium.com/code-for-canada/prototyping-in-the-public-service-d08ee695434a).

### Who we interviewed

In total, there are thousands of public servants in B.C. who fall into one or more of our user groups. To make user research and outreach more manageable, we started our research by focusing specifically on teams located around us in B.C.’s Exchange Lab, along with other teams from across government connected to the Exchange Lab’s community. 

To date, we’ve conducted nine interviews with teams from the five Natural Resource Ministries, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Citizens’ Services. For each of these teams, we met with product/service owners, developers, architects and designers to understand their product development journeys and the related technology choices they make along the way.

### What we learned

Based on our research, we came up with a set of design criteria that should guide our work on common components. These principles will guide our work moving forward.

Common Components should:

- _Be easy to find_. Teams struggle to find reusable components today, and wanted an easy place to go to find BC’s common components. Notably, teams often go to Google first to find reusable components built by other teams in BC, so search engine optimization (SEO) is also important.
- _Have simple, plain-language descriptions_. Teams need simple, plain-language descriptions of common components, including key features. This should be easy to read and understand for everyone - not just technologists.
- _Be easy to onboard to_. Once they’ve evaluated components, teams look for good developer documentation with clear instructions, sample implementations and even a sandbox to test a component. All of this can remove friction and facilitate self-serve onboarding.
- _Have published usage information_. Common components aren’t common if they aren’t being used. Teams like to see usage data, like the number of services onboarded or the number of transactions. This helps inform their decisions about whether or not to onboard to a component.
- _Include user testimonials and reviews_. One of the first questions teams ask when evaluating components is whether their peers like it or not. Having an easy way to see reviews and testimonials from existing users will help teams decide whether or not to onboard to a component. In absence of this, technologists have been polling a “shadow network” of knowledgeable architects to inform whether or not to onboard to a component.
- _Be supported_, with clearly articulated uptime and support information. We learned a lot about how much teams dread “shelfware” software that isn’t supported. Before they onboard to a common component, they want to know that someone is supporting it. Teams running critical apps also care deeply about uptime and SLAs.
