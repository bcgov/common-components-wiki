# Progress and Results

## Our roadmap

You can follow our work using this [open roadmap](https://trello.com/b/vqqXYk3l/common-components-mission-control). This is where we track our current and potential future missions. 

## How we measure results

For common services to be successful, they must actually be common. That means that we’ll be defining success through objective, consumption based metrics. 

To gauge whether our work is successful, we’ll use the following metrics: 
- Time and cost of to onboard to a common component;
- Number of services using a common component;
- Average cost per transaction on a common component; and,
- Number of transactions on a common component.

As we implement common components, we’ll publish progress on these metrics here.
