# Sprint 1 - Blastoff!
After completing a number of inception tasks following a [Kanban](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban) approach, the Common Components Team ("CoCo") transitioned to two week sprints as part of our [agile delivery process](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Agile-Delivery-Process/Agile-Delivery-Process). In our first sprint we **blasted off** with initial [user research](https://bcgov.github.io/common-components-wiki/user-research) and our first prototype, called the [OpenShift Launchpad](https://github.com/bcgov/openshift-launchpad).

## Sprint Goals
- Complete an MVP workshop and user interviews with several teams across government
- Create a simple [Hello World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) boilerplate: a React/Python/PostgreSQL web application that can be deployed on OpenShift

## Sprint Review
Our sprint review slides are [shared here as a PDF](https://bcgov.github.io/common-components-wiki/media/sprint_slides/CoCo_Sprint_1-Blastoff.pdf). We host an open sprint review every two weeks that is available in the BC Exchange Lab events calendar. Please contact us if you would like an invitation!

## Next Sprint
In our next sprint we are heading into the **Troposphere** (sprint 2) and will be focused on the following:

- Make OpenShift Launchpad into something others can consume
- Distill our discovery findings into something shareable and actionable (likely some lightweight prototypes and journeymaps)

Our discovery findings will be shared out broadly as soon as possible. Further work on the Launchpad will include distributing a PR showcasing our work for feedback (after a tiny bit of additional polish) and beginning to integrate a CI/CD pipeline / the BCDK.

If you just can't wait, the Launchpad repository may be found here any time: https://github.com/bcgov/openshift-launchpad
