# Shared Resources

In 2019, the BC Government created a new Digital and Data Office (the “Division”) within the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) in the Ministry of Citizens’ Services. Rather than focusing on back-office IT like the rest of the OCIO, this new division has a mandate is to create the conditions required for the Province to use modern tools and ways of working to improve services to citizens and make government more effective and responsive.

FreshWorks is partnering with CGI to deliver this project. FreshWorks will provide a full agile development team and product strategist, while CGI will provide strategic advice and program management expertise to the Province.
