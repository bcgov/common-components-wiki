# BC Common Components (CoCo) Weeknote 20
> ## 2020-05-29
___

This is a weekly post recapping what the BC Common Components “CoCo” team has done this week and what we plan to accomplish next week.

This week's note continues to focus on our work under the province's COVID-19 response.

## Done
- Published bug fixes to the endpoint to receive data from the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). PHAC has been able to submit test data to the production endpoint without any issues. 
- Worked on a first cut of filtering duplicate data between PHAC and the [Enhanced Travel Screening](https://www.travelscreening.gov.bc.ca/) (ETS) system. The intention here is to reduce scenarios in which Service BC makes multiple phone calls to the same household.

## Doing Next
- Test out duplicate filtering with synthetic data. 
- PHAC is expected to provision its production environment this week. Once they are ready to send over production data we will monitor how well our duplicate filtering script performs and make decisions on what needs to be improved.
- Text changes in the collection notice for both [Farm Operator Screening](https://farmoperatorscreening.gov.bc.ca/) and [Enhanced Travel Screening](https://www.travelscreening.gov.bc.ca/) systems.
