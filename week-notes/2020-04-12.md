# BC Common Components (CoCo) Weeknote 13
> ## 2020-04-12
___

This is a weekly post recapping what the BC Common Components “CoCo” team has done this week and what we plan to accomplish next week. The CoCo mission control dashboard is [here](https://trello.com/b/vqqXYk3l/common-components-mission-control).
 
This week's note is another special COVID-19 edition of our weeknotes. On Sunday, we received a request to help the Ministry of Health build a new digital service to support British Columbians returning from abroad to self isolate. The catch was, we had to deliver this new service in just a few days to meet timelines from [Premier Horgan's announcement](https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020PREM0019-000657).

Team CoCo more than rose to the occasion. In less than five days, we built a [new service](https://www.travelscreening.gov.bc.ca/) in partnership with the Ministry of Health, the Government Digital Experience Division and ServiceBC, which went live on Friday afternoon. Since we went live, the team has been iteratively adding features in response to feedback from front-line workers on the ground at Vancouver International Airport, and have been working to integrate with ServiceBC's call center workflow management system.

We're all quite exhausted after the longest week most of us have ever worked, but are very proud of our contribution to help keep British Columbians safe during this ongoing pandemic. We can't wait to demo what we've built at our next sprint review.
