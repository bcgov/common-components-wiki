# Sprint 2 - Troposphere
In our second sprint we continued to focus on improvements to [OpenShift Launchpad](https://github.com/bcgov/openshift-launchpad) in order to reach a stable point for a [public PR](https://github.com/bcgov/openshift-launchpad/pull/30) where we invite community feedback. This has been shared widely within the BC Exchange Lab and is publicly accessible for anyone to review and comment.

We also received our first contributions toward OpenShift Launchpad from the [Common Services Showcase Team](https://bcgov.github.io/common-service-showcase/) - a big shoutout for contributing a [Vue frontend](https://github.com/bcgov/openshift-launchpad-fe-vue) option and a [Node backend](https://github.com/bcgov/openshift-launchpad-be-node) option! In future sprints these will be integrated as easily-selected technology choices.

Additionally, we began work on a proof of concept to explore deployment to OpenShift using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). In this sprint we achieved PR-based deployments of Launchpad to OpenShift, which you can [see a demo of in this video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TS0Dsl4BEyKGJOg_B-dLKh-hKWl6vl3c).

Continuing our user research, we interviewed an additional two teams with connections to the BC Exchange Lab: one of the Registries teams and Mines Digital Services. From our user interviews to date we have identified four stages that teams progress through as they build a product:
1. Inception
1. Proof of Concept
1. Minimum Viable Product
1. Active Product Development

Finally, we successfully set up a public wiki space where our progress and results can be shared with anyone: the site you're reading this on right now!

## Sprint Goals
- Get [OpenShift Launchpad](https://github.com/bcgov/openshift-launchpad) polished enough to be something others can consume
- Distill our discovery findings into something shareable and actionable

## Sprint Review
Our sprint review slides are [shared here as a PDF](https://bcgov.github.io/common-components-wiki/media/sprint_slides/CoCo_Sprint_2-Troposphere.pdf) and include additional details on:
- The stages a team goes through during development
- How teams evaluate components as possible solutions

We host an open sprint review every two weeks that is available in the BC Exchange Lab events calendar. Please contact us if you would like an invitation!

## Next Sprint
In our next sprint we are reviewing our backlog and community feedback to determine what's **Still Relevant**. We will be focused on moving our user research forward while incorporating what we've learned so far into our products and the way we work.
