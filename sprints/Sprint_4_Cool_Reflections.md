# Sprint 4 - Cool Reflections
In this sprint our main focus was on building out a first iteration of the Common Components Catalogue. There is currently a staging instance of the catalogue available at the following link: http://catalogue-staging-client-apdwlc-test.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/

Right now the catalogue consists of three views:
1. The home page, where content explaining the purpose of the catalogue is coming soon
1. The catalogue itself, where common components and services are listed
1. A detailed information page for each catalogue entry

We are very interested in community feedback on our work, so please reach out if you have any questions or comments on the product so far.

In addition, we continued to provide support to the Wildfire Predictive Services (WPS) Team to ensure the [OpenShift Launchpad deployment solution](https://github.com/bcgov/openshift-launchpad-deployment) reached a state of maturity for them to implement it in their project during their next sprint. This included updating the solution to enable the use of custom scripts and configuration.

## Sprint Goals
- Deploy a first cut of the Common Components Catalogue following an initial style guide
- Distill learnings from our experience building [OpenShift Launchpad](https://github.com/bcgov/openshift-launchpad) into tickets and documentation

## Sprint Review
Our sprint review slides are [shared here as a PDF](https://bcgov.github.io/common-components-wiki/media/sprint_slides/CoCo_Sprint_4-Cool_Reflections.pdf). We host an open sprint review every two weeks that is available in the BC Exchange Lab events calendar. Please contact us if you would like an invitation!

## Next Sprint
In our next sprint we are going to focus on:
- Polishing the user experience of the Common Components Catalogue
- Attempting use of [Canadaâ€™s Notify service](https://notification.alpha.canada.ca/) to solve a real-world use case: email notifications of OpenShift service disruptions
- Tying up loose ends on Launchpad to ensure a new team can use it easily
