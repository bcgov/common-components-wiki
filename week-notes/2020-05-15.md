# BC Common Components (CoCo) Weeknote 18
> ## 2020-05-15
___

This is a weekly post recapping what the BC Common Components “CoCo” team has done this week and what we plan to accomplish next week.

This week's note continues to focus on our work under the province's COVID-19 response.

## Done
- Created a test endpoint for PHAC (Public Health Agency Canada) to integrate with.
- Came up with an interim strategy to unblock Service BC while we wait on integration from PHAC.
  - PHAC may not be able to move as fast as required to integrate with our system.
  - In the meantime, there is a manual process that is already underway wherein data is received via excel and manually followed up on by Service BC.
  - Team CoCo has proposed an interim solution in which the excel file can be converted to a CSV and parsed using a script to the [Enhanced Travel Screening](https://www.travelscreening.gov.bc.ca/) system for submission to the Service BC system.
  - We discussed this approach with Service BC who agreed that this will save a lot of work parsing and entering data manually allowing Service BC to follow up with citizens more efficiently.

## Doing Next
- Full steam ahead on the CSV parser solution to send federal data over to Service BC. Since the upcoming week is a short week, we will most likely focus solely on this piece from a development standpoint.
