# BC Common Components (CoCo) Weeknote 19
> ## 2020-05-22
___

This is a weekly post recapping what the BC Common Components “CoCo” team has done this week and what we plan to accomplish next week.

This week's note continues to focus on our work under the province's COVID-19 response.

## Done
- Met with Service BC to gather requirements on how best to filter data received from Public Health Agency Canada (PHAC). 
- Created a number of test cases and scenarios to filter out duplicates.
  - As part of the citizen experience and efficiency of operations, Service BC would like the [Enhanced Travel Screening](https://www.travelscreening.gov.bc.ca/) (ETS) system to filter out duplicates so that they do not make repeated calls to the same household.
  - This is also perhaps the trickiest part of the PHAC integration as accounting for user errors and the different formats of the PHAC dataset and the ETS dataset means that confidence levels when filtering for duplicates varies.
- Improved logging to ensure traceability of when a determination was made and by whom.
- Published a couple of minor text changes to the [Farm Operator Screening](https://farmoperatorscreening.gov.bc.ca/) system.

## Doing Next
- Continue to work on PHAC integration.
